** Scope

An application for practice purposes combining java swing and spring boot.

The theme of the application is a SUDOKU game

** Running
First you need to clone the repository on your computer.

*** Unix systems
To run on a unix like system there is a =run.sh= script
You have to give this =run.sh= permission to execute

#+begin_src bash
chmod +x run.sh
#+end_src

and then you can call the script to run the program

#+begin_src  bash
./run.sh
#+end_src

you can also pass arguments to the script to pass it down
to the application

#+begin_src  bash
./run.sh first_argument second_argument
#+end_src

*** Windows (untested)
I don't have access to a windows enviroment to test this,
but I did create a =run.bat= script with llm assistence that
maybe can run the application.

According to llm you can just call run.bat from the project directory
and it should run

#+begin_src  bash
run.bat
#+end_src

It should also work with arguments

#+begin_src  bash
./run.sh first_argument second_argument
#+end_src
